# Human Activity Recognition Model

This project uses data from UCI's <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones">Human Activity dataset</a>. It contains 3-dimensional data from a Samsung Galaxy 2 smartwatch gyroscope and accelerometer, with a class classification into 1 of 6 categories -- WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

Our notebook contains data exploration, preprocessing, and a LSTM model to classify the data. Please take a look at our report for a full case study rundown.
